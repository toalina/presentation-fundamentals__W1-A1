        <p class="relatives-p">In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world's first photomontage by combining five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on her deathbed. "Fading Away" - Robinson's first and most famous composite photo - depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

        <p class="p1"><em>On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province's <strong>Banqiao Dam</strong> while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race theyw ere about to lose.</em></p>
        <p class="p2"><em>Just after 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, "The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!"</em></p>
        <p class="p3"><em>There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it "sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking." The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.</em></p>
